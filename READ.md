# PostgreSQL for Data Analysis & AI Foundations

This repository is the **first step** in a guided learning path focused on
**AI, Data Science, and data pipelines**.

The goal is to build **strong analytical thinking using SQL** before moving
to NoSQL systems, APIs, or machine learning tools.


---

## 🎯 Learning Goal

By the end of this stage, students should be able to:

- Understand how structured data is stored
- Write analytical SQL queries
- Aggregate and summarize data
- Prepare data for AI and Data Science pipelines

---

## 🧠 Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is used because it:

- Enforces data structure
- Supports advanced analytical SQL
- Transfers directly to:
  - Pandas
  - Spark
  - Data Warehouses
  - Feature engineering pipelines

Learning PostgreSQL first makes everything later **much easier**.

## 📚 Topics Covered (Instructor-Led)

### 🔹 SQL Fundamentals

- Databases, tables, rows, columns
- Data types
- Primary keys
- Foreign keys
- Types of relationships
- Filtering with `WHERE`
- Sorting with `ORDER BY`

---

### 🔹 Joins (Core Analytical Skill)

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL JOIN
- Fact tables vs dimension tables
- Real-world join examples

---

### 🔹 Aggregations

- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- Aggregate functions:
  - COUNT
  - SUM
  - AVG
  - MIN
  - MAX

---

### 🔹 Advanced Grouping (Analytics-Oriented)

- GROUPING SETS
- ROLLUP
- CUBE
- Multi-level aggregations
- Reporting-style queries

---

### 🔹 Window Functions (CRITICAL)

Window functions are essential for analytics and ML preparation.

Topics include:

- OVER (PARTITION BY, ORDER BY)
- Difference between GROUP BY and window functions

#### Ranking Functions

- ROW_NUMBER()
- RANK()
- DENSE_RANK()

#### Aggregate Window Functions

- SUM() OVER()
- AVG() OVER()
- Running totals
- Moving averages

---

## 🧠 Why These Topics Matter for AI & Data Science

These SQL concepts map directly to:

- Feature engineering
- Time-series analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Pandas transformations
- ML pipeline preparation

---

## ⚠️ Scope Rules

- ✅ SQL thinking only

This stage is about **data understanding**, not tools.

---

## 🧭 What Comes Next

After completing this repository, we will move to:

➡️ **MongoDB for Data Pipelines**

Where we will learn how to work with **semi-structured data** and ingestion pipelines.
